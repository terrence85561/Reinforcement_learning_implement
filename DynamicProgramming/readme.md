In part 1, I built up two dummy terminal state as 0 and 100. I also found that, the output plot matches the plot in textbook better if the selected actions are in range of (1,min(state,100-state))

To change the parameter of head probability, please change the variable 'ph' in line47

Use python3 to run the program and plot the graph.
