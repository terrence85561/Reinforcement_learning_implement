Use python3 to run rndmwalk_policy_evaluation.py and obtain the true value function file,
which named as "TrueValueFunction.npy". I also submit this file ran by myself.

Use python3 to run randomWalk_exp.py and obtain the estimate value function file,
which named as "randomwalk.npy".

Then use python3 to run plot.py to plot the graph of tabular agent and tile coding agent.
It takes around 180 seconds for tabular agent and 170 seconds for tile coding agent to finish.
